The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) is a standard to communicate Supply Chain and every-day vulnerabilities in an automated fashion. It therefore leverages the potential of SBOM and implements VEX. CSAF allows for the disclosure of security-related vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and specifications in machine-readable format. It supports automation of the production, distribution, and consumption of security advisories—reducing the time between when vulnerabilities are disclosed and when businesses remediate them. That’s why the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [recently listed the widespread adoption of CSAF as one of “three critical steps to advance the vulnerability management ecosystem.”](https://www.cisa.gov/blog/2022/11/10/transforming-vulnerability-management-landscape)

In this webinar, members of the OASIS Open Technical Committee that developed CSAF will review the standard and explain its potential impact on vulnerability management. They will also demonstrate how CSAF documents work with Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) and implement the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) to improve global cybersecurity.

**Thomas Schmidt**
Subject Matter Expert @German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)
Thomas Schmidt works in the Industrial Automation and Control Systems section of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). His focus is the automation of advisories at both sides: vendors/CERTs and asset owners. Schmidt has been a leader in the OASIS Open CSAF technical committee and key in bridging this work with the CISA SBOM work. To increase the security of ICS and the broader ecosystem, BSI responsibilities cover many areas including establishing trust and good relations with vendors and asset owners. Schmidt completed his master's in IT-Security at Ruhr-University Bochum (Germany) which included a period of research at the SCADA Security Laboratory of Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane, Australia).
